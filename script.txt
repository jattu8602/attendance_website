hey i wanna discuss an idea with you about making a website for attendence system application schools register , so what will happen is we will create a cool looking website named attendence_website it must have a lot of ui and animations in frontpage  login button in the top having google auth based on the registered email for schools , it has a button register as school button points to the registration of the school where they need to add the school first so we can ask something like this data there in step-1(this must be the one time information but if school want to change it they have to reverify the  email then only can change from the dashboard profile section ) email and confirm email  by any method {
        "name":"PARAM POOJYA SHREE RAMKRISHNA SARASWATI GURUKUL",
        "aff_no":1130144,
        "state":"MAHARASHTRA",
        "district":"JALGAON",
        "region":"CHENNAI",
        "address":"AT-UMALE, POST-DHANWAD,",
        "pincode":425003.0
    },     then in step -2 (can also be edited from actual dashboard) we can ask for  teachers name with their email id and mobile number  ,  in step-3(can also be edited from actual dashboard) they can assign the classes via entering the name and number of students to each  teacher  , now the dashboard page comes up after registration / login     (make sure if once college logged in then store the session and dont let him logout until he logouts by own ), so it contains the all teachers name we can select each teacher name from there , let we selected one teacher named(jatin) so after that we can see his assigned classes then after clicking on each class we can see the table having present absent of every student with date , rollnumber - name in a table format (datewise) let me talk about this data we will not store the data here currently of present absent here it will come from the present_sir mobiile application , what we can do here is we can add students to any class with their roll number(increasing order based on input (preselect this info like from where to where like rollnunmber format 12-100,AD23-AD-38 like it can be anything but it is a roll number we know from one point to another point in increaseing order depending on last digits  )) name , and mobile number (college can edit this data anytime ) after entering this data college can finally see the lots of horizontal and vertical lines having empty spaces for present and absent mark (this ui of the website can we zoomable and responsive ) , after all this i need to know one thing i will be transferring this all data to my mobile app and i have build the flutter mobile app recently so i want present absent information from app to website can it be possible ,              and i want to build the website in next js , no src directory , i can use mongodb/postgres anything , and prisma thats it ,,,,,,,,,,,, what are your thoughts
